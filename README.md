# Buenos Aires Tree Census - Maps on Python/Tableau

## Dataset Overview
🗺 The dataset contains data on trees found along the public sidewalks of Buenos Aires. It provides information on tree species, locations, and other key characteristics. 

🔍 The data will be analyzed and visualized to provide insights into the distribution and density of trees across the city's urban landscape. 🗺

## Comuna and Shapefile
Buenos Aires is divided into political divisions known as *Comunas*. To facilitate comparative analysis, a shapefile of these Communes will be loaded. This will allow us to map and compare tree data within each Comuna.

## Analysis and Visualizations

### Python Maps:
- **Total Tree Count per Comuna**: A map displaying the total number of trees in each Comuna.
- **Jacaranda Tree Locations**: A map highlighting the locations of all Jacaranda trees in Buenos Aires.
- **Tree Density by Comuna**: A map showing the density of trees across different Comunas.
